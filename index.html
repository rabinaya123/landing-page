                 <h1 >Espresso</h1>
                <p> Espresso is a strong, concentrated coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water through finely-ground coffee beans under high pressure. Originating in Italy, espresso is known for its rich flavor and thick, creamy layer of foam on top, called "crema."

                    Espresso serves as the base for many popular coffee drinks, including lattes, cappuccinos, and macchiatos.  <a href="https://www.amazon.in/s?k=espresso+nescafe&adgrpid=1318316048494005&hvadid=82395012165110&hvbmt=bb&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=149503&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=b&hvtargid=kwd-82395632899155%3Aloc-90&hydadcr=20216_1921154&msclkid=662d64514af919f2c7a703529bd98e41&tag=msndeskstdin-21&ref=pd_sl_7t5azcji3j_b">espresso</a> </p>

                                 <p>A latte is a popular coffee drink made with espresso and steamed milk. The word "latte" comes from the Italian "caff√® latte," which means "milk coffee." It's typically composed of one or two shots of espresso, topped with a generous amount of steamed milk, and finished with a small layer of milk foam.

                                    Lattes are often enjoyed plain or flavored with syrups like vanilla, caramel, or hazelnut. Baristas sometimes create intricate designs, known as "latte art," in the foam.<a href="https://www.nescafe.com/in/latte#:~:text=NESCAF%C3%89%C2%AE%20Latte.%20Curious%20about%20latte's?%20Read%20on%20to">latte</a></p>
